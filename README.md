This application is a simple radiometric dating calculator which will prompt a user from a menu to select a given radioactive element and its decay product. 
Once a selection has been made it will prompt the user to enter the percentage of original isotope (nuclides) 
which will then calculate the decay rate from parent to daughter nuclide. 
This will keep a count of how many half-lives have passed and will calculate this number with the constant decay rate of the given sample. 
The final result will be an age range of the sample with its appropriate time period.
