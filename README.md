The application is a radiometric dating calculator designed for simplicity. Users select a radioactive element and its decay product from a menu. They then input the percentage of the original isotope remaining, which the calculator uses to determine the decay rate from parent to daughter nuclide. The program tracks the number of half-lives elapsed and calculates the age range of the sample based on the constant decay rate, providing an estimated time period for the sample's age.
